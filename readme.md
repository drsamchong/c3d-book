To create a conda environment, use the environment.yml file.

`conda env create --file environment.yml`

The requirements_conda[_mac].txt files might also work to create a conda environment with the same versions as the code was created:

`conda create --name <env> --file requirements_conda[_mac].txt`

but using the yaml file via the earlier command is probably less likely to cause issues.
