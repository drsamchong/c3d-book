    "Relational database management systems (RDBMS) offer one approach to structuring data storage: They store data in tables, where relationships between data points are explicitly defined. Unlike spreadsheets, which can contain duplicated or inconsistent information, relational databases enforce data integrity and reduce redundancy through **normalisation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistence** Data is stored safely and remains available even after the program or system shuts down.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structure and integrity** Data is organised into tables with clearly defined relationships, reducing errors and inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability and Efficiency** Efficient querying through SQL (Structured Query Language) allows rapid retrieval and filtering of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessibility** Multiple users and systems can access and manipulate the data concurrently without conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a structured storage system like a relational database (db) enables a transition from unstructured data (e.g. scattered experimental records in spreadsheets) to a system where data is systematically stored, so that it remains accessible and useful for downstream automation and decision-making.\n",

Simply storing available data in a single table is not the most effective way to achieve those goals. Designing the structure of the database using concepts such as data normalisation can help to avoid inconsistencies in the data and overly complex relationships between tables, for example.\n",

    "### Structured Query Language (SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Structured Query Language](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/structured-query-language) (SQL) is a language used to query and manipulate databases. In CHEM501, you used a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database to store data in a structured form. You were able to connect to the database using python and execute queries in raw SQL, and this included adding data from a pandas `DataFrame` to a table in an SQL database.\n",

    "\n",
    "Being able to connect Python with a database such as a SQL db, offers the advantages of being able carry out data processing, analysis and modelling using the wide range of Python libraries, standardising data processes before storing the processed and analysed data in a persistent, structured format that is accessible to multiple users.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automation and integration with data sources and workflows\n",
    "   - Python can enable integration with lab instruments, data pipelines, and machine learning models.\n",
    "   - This can faciliate automated data entry, validation, and retrieval without manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data processing and analysis \n",
    "   - Python provides a wide variety of libraries (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, etc.) for analysing and visualising stored data.\n",
    "   - Data can be accessed directly from the database, processed, and piped into further optimisation or scientific models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reproducibility & Consistency\n",
    "   - Developing Python scripts for data processing can ensure that it is standardised and reproducible across experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "[SQLalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) is a package that lets you interact with a SQL database using python. It provides an abstraction layer over the raw SQL: It distances you from SQL, so you do not need to write raw SQL. This can make database interactions easier and more 'Pythonic'. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also means that it is more straightforward to change the underlying SQL database (e.g. from SQLite to mySQL or PostgreSQL) if you decide to later.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy manages connections to the database, so you do not need to worry about closing connections. The abstraction away from raw SQL queries means data validation can be built in and can prevent security issues like SQL injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an [SQLalchemy with sqlite tutorial ](https://builtin.com/data-science/python-sqlalchemy) that will help as you work through the notebook. The main points you will see in this notebook focus on getting started quickly using familiar data structures in Python, by showing how straightforward working with pandas dataframes and a sql database can be."
