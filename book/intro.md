# Chemical Data, Discovery and Design

[Canvas site](https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/77489)

You can access the GitHub repository containing the markdown files and notebooks [here](https://github.com/drsamchong/c3d-book/tree/aee759b22661ad0a42f927152a147cc17c0023d0/book) or by hovering over the Octocat button at the top right and clicking on Repository. 

The code is available in the `book` directory.

There is a readme and environment yaml/requirements files which should hopefully enable you create a conda environment in which you can run the notebooks.

The repo is also hosted on [Binder](https://mybinder.org), but Binder seems to be having some issues. Theoretically, once it is restored, you should be able to work interactively with the notebooks by hovering over the rocket launch button at the top on a notebook page and clicking on Binder or launching the notebook interactively.
