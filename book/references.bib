We provide an overview of the background theory and the essential rules necessary for manipulating conditional probabilities and density functions (pdfs) i.e. the product and marginalisation rules. Drawing on these rules we demonstrate, using a variety of examples from chemistry, how Bayes theorem can be adapted to analyse and interpret experimental data for a wide range of typical chemistry experiments, including basic model selection (i.e. hypothesis testing), parameter estimation, peak refinement and advanced model selection. An outline of the steps and underlying assumptions are presented, while necessary mathematics are also discussed.},

  abstract = {We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighborhood environments, and analyze their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal.}

While this perception seems to be true with regards to the traditional methods and applications of chemometrics, this article argues that advances in instrumentation, computation, and statistical theory may combine to drive a resurgence in chemometrics research. Previous surges in chemometrics research activity were driven by the development of new ways of making better use of available information. Bayesian statistics can further enhance the ability to use domain specific information to obtain more accurate and useful models, and presents many research opportunities as well as challenges. Although Bayesian statistics is not new, recent advances via sampling-based Monte Carlo methods make these methods practical for large scale applications without making the common assumptions of Gaussian noise and uniform prior distributions, made by most chemometric methods. This article provides an overview of traditional chemometric methods from a Bayesian view and a tutorial of some recently developed techniques in Bayesian chemometrics, such as Bayesian PCA and Bayesian latent variable regression. New challenges and opportunities for future work are also identified.},

  abstract = {The rapid adoption of big data, machine learning (ML), and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in chemical discovery has heightened the importance of quantifying molecular similarity. Molecular similarity, commonly assessed as the distance between molecular fingerprints, is integral to applications such as database curation, diversity analysis, and property prediction. AI tools frequently rely on these similarity measures to cluster molecules under the assumption that structurally similar molecules exhibit similar properties. However, this assumption is not universally valid, particularly for continuous properties like electronic structure properties. Despite the prevalence of fingerprint-based similarity measures, their evaluation has largely depended on biological activity datasets and qualitative metrics, limiting their relevance for non-biological domains. To address this gap, we propose a framework to evaluate the correlation between molecular similarity measures and molecular properties. Our approach builds on the concept of neighborhood behavior and incorporates kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis to quantify how well similarity measures capture property relationships. Using a dataset of over 350 million molecule pairs with electronic structure, redox, and optical properties, we systematically evaluate the correlation between several molecular fingerprint generators, distance functions, and these properties. Both the curated dataset and the evaluation framework are publicly available.},

However, when the scientific connection between the descriptor and the actuating mechanisms is unclear, the causality of the learned descriptor-property relation is uncertain. Thus, a trustful prediction of new promising materials, identification of anomalies, and scientific advancement are doubtful. We analyze this issue and define requirements for a suitable descriptor. For a classic example, the energy difference of zinc blende or wurtzite and rocksalt semiconductors, we demonstrate how a meaningful descriptor can be found systematically.}

  abstract = {Reaction optimization is challenging and traditionally delegated to domain experts who iteratively propose increasingly optimal experiments. Problematically, the reaction landscape is complex and often requires hundreds of experiments to reach convergence, representing an enormous resource sink. Bayesian optimization (BO) is an optimization algorithm that recommends the next experiment based on previous observations and has recently gained considerable interest in the general chemistry community. The application of BO for chemical reactions has been demonstrated to increase efficiency in optimization campaigns and can recommend favorable reaction conditions amidst many possibilities. Moreover, its ability to jointly optimize desired objectives such as yield and stereoselectivity makes it an attractive alternative or at least complementary to domain expert-guided optimization. With the democratization of BO software, the barrier of entry to applying BO for chemical reactions has drastically lowered. The intersection between the paradigms will see advancements at an ever-rapid pace. In this review, we discuss how chemical reactions can be transformed into machine-readable formats which can be learned by machine learning (ML) models. We present a foundation for BO and how it has already been applied to optimize chemical reaction outcomes. The important message we convey is that realizing the full potential of ML-augmented reaction optimization will require close collaboration between experimentalists and computational scientists.},

Examples include the prediction of properties, the discovery of new reaction pathways, or the design of new molecules. The machine needs to read and write fluently in a chemical language for each of these tasks. Strings are a common tool to represent molecular graphs, and the most popular molecular string representation, SMILES, has powered cheminformatics since the late 1980s. However, in the context of AI and ML in chemistry, SMILES has several shortcomings---most pertinently, most combinations of symbols lead to invalid results with no valid chemical interpretation. To overcome this issue, a new language for molecules was introduced in 2020 that guarantees 100\% robustness: SELF-referencing embedded string (SELFIES). SELFIES has since simplified and enabled numerous new applications in chemistry. In this perspective, we look to the future and discuss molecular string representations, along with their respective opportunities and challenges. We propose 16 concrete future projects for robust molecular representations. These involve the extension toward new chemical domains, exciting questions at the interface of AI and robust languages, and interpretability for both humans and machines. We hope that these proposals will inspire several follow-up works exploiting the full potential of molecular string representations for the future of AI in chemistry and materials science.},

  abstract = {Molecular similarity is a pervasive concept in chemistry. It is essential to many aspects of chemical reasoning and analysis and is perhaps the fundamental assumption underlying medicinal chemistry. Dissimilarity, the complement of similarity, also plays a major role in a growing number of applications of molecular diversity in combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening, and related fields. How molecular information is represented, called the representation problem, is important to the type of molecular similarity analysis (MSA) that can be carried out in any given situation. In this work, four types of mathematical structure are used to represent molecular information: sets, graphs, vectors, and functions. Molecular similarity is a pairwise relationship that induces structure into sets of molecules, giving rise to the concept of chemical space. Although all three concepts -- molecular similarity, molecular representation, and chemical space -- are treated in this chapter, the emphasis is on molecular similarity measures. Similarity measures, also called similarity coefficients or indices, are functions that map pairs of compatible molecular representations that are of the same mathematical form into real numbers usually, but not always, lying on the unit interval. This chapter presents a somewhat pedagogical discussion of many types of molecular similarity measures, their strengths and limitations, and their relationship to one another. An expanded account of the material on chemical spaces presented in the first edition of this book is also provided. It includes a discussion of the topography of activity landscapes and the role that activity cliffs in these landscapes play in structure--activity studies.},

  abstract = {Similarity is a subjective and multifaceted concept, regardless of whether compounds or any other objects are considered. Despite its intrinsically subjective nature, attempts to quantify the similarity of compounds have a long history in chemical informatics and drug discovery. Many computational methods employ similarity measures to identify new compounds for pharmaceutical research. However, chemoinformaticians and medicinal chemists typically perceive similarity in different ways. Similarity methods and numerical readouts of similarity calculations are probably among the most misunderstood computational approaches in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we evaluate different similarity concepts, highlight key aspects of molecular similarity analysis, and address some potential misunderstandings. In addition, a number of practical aspects concerning similarity calculations are discussed.},

  abstract = {A new method of rapid pharmacophore fingerprinting (PharmPrint method) has been developed. A basis set of 10\,549 three-point pharmacophores has been constructed by enumerating several distance ranges and pharmacophoric features. Software has been developed to assign pharmacophoric types to atoms in chemical structures, generate multiple conformations, and construct the binary fingerprint according to the pharmacophores that result. The fingerprint is used as a descriptor for developing a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model using partial least squares. An example is given using sets of ligands for the estrogen receptor (ER). The result is compared with previously published results on the same data to show the superiority of a full 3D, conformationally flexible approach. The QSAR model can be readily interpreted in structural/chemical terms. Further examples are given using binary activity data and some of our novel in-house compounds, which show the value of the model when crossing compound classes.}

  abstract = {Computational approaches are increasingly used to predict toxicity due, in part, to pressures to find alternatives to animal testing. Read-across is the ``new paradigm'' which aims to predict toxicity by identifying similar, data rich, source compounds. This assumes that similar molecules tend to exhibit similar activities i.e. molecular similarity is integral to read-across. Various of molecular fingerprints and similarity measures may be used to calculate molecular similarity. This study investigated the value and concordance of the Tanimoto similarity values calculated using six widely used fingerprints within six toxicological datasets. There was considerable variability in the similarity values calculated from the various molecular fingerprints for diverse compounds, although they were reasonably concordant for homologous series acting via a common mechanism. The results suggest generic fingerprint-derived similarities are likely to be optimally predictive for local datasets, i.e. following sub-categorisation. Thus, for read-across, generic fingerprint-derived similarities are likely to be most predictive after chemicals are placed into categories (or groups), then similarity is calculated within those categories, rather than for a whole chemically diverse dataset.},

Two questions then arise. Which are the molecular descriptors that should be ``similar''? How much ``similarity'' is enough? These questions are answered by demonstrating that, if a molecular descriptor is to be a valid and useful measure of ``similarity'' in drug discovery, a plot of differences in its values vs differences in biological activities for a set of related molecules will exhibit a characteristic trapezoidal distribution enhancement, revealing a ``neighborhood behavior'' for the descriptor. Applying this finding to 20 datasets allows 11 molecular diversity descriptors to be ranked by their validity for compound library design.

PolymerGNN provides accurate estimates for polymer properties based on a database of complex and heterogeneous polyesters (linear/branched, homopolymers/copolymers) with experimentally refined properties. In PolymerGNN, each polyester is represented as a set of monomer units, which are introduced as molecular graphs. A virtual screening of a large, computationally generated database with materials of variable composition was performed, a task that demonstrates the applicability of the PolymerGNN on future studies that target the exploration of the polymer space.

  abstract = {Reaction optimization is fundamental to synthetic chemistry, from optimizing the yield of industrial processes to selecting conditions for the preparation of medicinal candidates1. Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems2. Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models3. Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry4--9; however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization~outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data). Overall, our studies suggest that adopting Bayesian optimization methods into everyday laboratory practices could facilitate more efficient synthesis of functional chemicals by enabling better-informed, data-driven decisions about which experiments to run.},

It is therefore no surprise that the aqueous solubility of compounds has a key role in various domains, including but not limited to drug discovery, paint, coating, and battery materials design. Measurement and prediction of aqueous solubility is a complex and prevailing challenge in chemistry. For the latter, different data-driven prediction models have recently been developed to augment the physics-based modeling approaches. To construct accurate data-driven estimation models, it is essential that the underlying experimental calibration data used by these models is of high fidelity and quality. Existing solubility datasets show variance in the chemical space of compounds covered, measurement methods, experimental conditions, but also in the non-standard representations, size, and accessibility of data. To address this problem, we generated a new database of compounds, AqSolDB, by merging a total of nine different aqueous solubility datasets, curating the merged data, standardizing and validating the compound representation formats, marking with reliability labels, and providing 2D descriptors of compounds as a Supplementary Resource.},

  abstract = {Similarity searching is one of the traditional and most widely applied approaches in chemical and pharmaceutical research to select compounds with desired properties from databases. The computational efficiency of many (but not all) similarity search techniques has further increased their popularity as compound databases began to rapidly grow in size. Different methods have been developed for small molecule similarity searching. However, foundations and intrinsic limitations of similarity searching are often not well understood, although a number of similarity methods are rather simplistic. Regardless of methodological details, all similarity search approaches depend on how molecular similarity is evaluated and quantified. In its essence, molecular similarity is a subjective concept and much dependent on how we represent and view molecular structures. Moreover, trying to understand the relationship between molecular similarity, however assessed, and structure-dependent properties including, first and foremost, biological activity continues to be a challenging problem. Consequently, although similarity searching usually provides a quantitative readout and a ranking of compounds relative to chosen reference molecules, predicting structure--activity relationships on the basis of calculated similarity values often involves subjective criteria and chemical intuition. Thus, similarity searching is still far from being a routine application in database mining. In this review, we first discuss important principles underlying similarity searching, describe its tasks, and introduce major categories of search methods. Then, we focus on molecular fingerprints, the design and application of which can be regarded as a paradigm for the similarity search field. {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

Everyone working with molecules, whether chemist or not, needs an understanding of the representation of molecules in a machinereadable format, as this is central to computational chemistry. Four classes of representations are introduced: string, connection table, feature-based, and computer-learned representations. Three of the most significant representations are simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES), International Chemical Identifier (InChI), and the MDL molfile, of which SMILES was the first to successfully be used in conjunction with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to yield a continuous representation of molecules. This is noteworthy because a continuous representation allows for efficient navigation of the immensely large chemical space of possible molecules. Since 2018, when the first model of this type was published, considerable effort has been put into developing novel and improved methodologies. Most, if not all, researchers in the community make their work easily accessible on GitHub, though discussion of computation time and domain of applicability is often overlooked. Herein, we present questions for consideration in future work which we believe will make chemical VAEs even more accessible.},
